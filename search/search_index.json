Tip If your Google Chrome does not work, you can switch to a different browser such as Microsoft Edge. Sometime Inspect Element will not work if you are logged into your YRDSB email when using the browser. How to Use Always read the official documentation! This is just a very basic run-down of the Chrome DevTools . For more information, see the official Chrome DevTools documentation. Their beautifully written documentation covers more in-depth topics. Click here for their reference! Click on an entry to bring it up. The entries, by default, are sorted downwards by time (the bottom-most entry will be the most recent request). Take note of important fields: You should see 6 tabs: Headers, Preview, Response, Timing, Cookies and Initiator. Under the Headers tabs, you should see the complete HTTP request and response being sent/received. Especially take note of the values under the General and Query String Parameters sections. Under the Request Headers section, watch out for the Content-Type field (if it exists). Note During a POST request, if the content-type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded , then you will see a Form Data section instead of a Query String Parameters . Tip Since Chrome nicely interprets the data for you, you can click \"View Source\" to see the raw data being sent: Can you guess what the source of the above data would be? That's right! It's username=aa password=bb Under the Preview tab, you should see the human-readable formatted/parsed response from the server. If the response is in JSON, then Chrome will format it into a tree/accordion. If the response is a HTML document, the Chrome will render the document for you. Here's an example of a formatted JSON preview: Under the Response tab, you should see the raw unformatted data that the server sent back. Under the Cookies tab, you should see all the cookies the server sent back. Life Hacks You can open the Inspect Element window with the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-I on PC. Warning When the website refreshes, you will loose all your previous logs (and possibly important information). To avoid this, click Preserve Log (as shown below): Danger When your logs become too messy, you should clear it to avoid confusing yourself! To clear your logs, click the \"Clear\" button: Click on the \"Filter\" icon to bring up the possible filter options. Sometimes, you may wish to find only particular queries. For example, you can filter out everything except XHR (XmlHttpRequests) by clicking the \"XHR\" button. How to View/Edit/Delete Stored Cookies Always read the official documentation! There's no use to writing anything if you can just see a better version here ! But I use Firefox! Well, you're in luck my friend.

Simply put, SQLi enables us to inject custom (malicious) SQL commands. According to OWASP , SQLi was listed as the #1 of its top 10 web vulnerabilities list. Attack Types/Categories In-band In an in-band SQLi attack, the attacker uses the same channel to perform the attack and to receive data about the attack. Here, we have direct, explicit, feedback during the attack. a Blind/Inferential During a blind SQLi attack, the attacker has no immediate feedback. Instead, we must observe the server responses and behavior in order to learn more about the server's structure. a Out-of-band This is an alternative to inferential time-based techniques, especially if the server responses are not very stable (making an inferential time-based attack unreliable).

Are we trying to inject new users? 1. \"Where\": The Attack Surface Introduction Check out OWASP OWASP has released a bunch of great resources. For example, I took this list from them. You might be interested in this too. Obviously if there's no way to interact with an application (i.e., a black box) then there's nothing to exploit. We have to identify possible places where a vulnerability could be hiding. Some specific points of entry are listed below. Be sure to keep track of: User interface (UI) forms and fields HTTP headers and cookies APIs Files/Other local storage Databases Email or other kinds of messages You may want to group the elements above into different types, such as: Login/authentication entry points Admin interfaces Inquiries and search functions Data entry (CRUD) forms Transactional interfaces/APIs Operational command and monitoring interfaces/APIs Interfaces with other applications/systems From OWASP's \"Attack Surface Analysis Cheat Sheet\" For web apps you can use a tool like the OWASP ZAP or Arachni or Skipfish or w3af or one of the many commercial dynamic testing and vulnerability scanning tools or services to crawl your app and map the parts of the application that are accessible over the web. Once you've made your list of common entry points, you should determine how the website interacts with it. Examples are given below. Examples Here are some examples and some possible questions you can ask yourself! A login is a possible attack surface. How does the website log you in? How are your credentials sent to the website? Is it through an HTTP POST request? What is being sent? Are there any hidden values being sent? Tip You can investigate further through capturing Network Requests using DevTools! Pro Tip Sometimes websites will more data than you give it. These are usually in the form of hidden fields. Cookies can be a possible attack surface. What cookies are being sent? What information do the cookies encode/represent? Are the cookies encrypted? How are the cookies encrypted? Why are the cookies being sent? Tip Be sure to check common encodings such as Base64, JWT or even AES! Warning Sometimes, cookies can be misleading! Be sure to ignore cookies starting with GA_ as those are Google Analytics cookies. Data entry forms are a possible attack surface. Where and how is the data being sent? Can you see the data after? How is the data being displayed after being entered into the system? Where does data go after? Can you see it? What does a SQL insert statement look like? SQL is not the only thing out there! Ever heard of Flask? HTTP Requests are a possible attack surface.

Each step builds on the code from the previous step. Note that we will be using Python 2 for this lesson. Example: https://hangman.redapple410.repl.run Example code: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman 0: Getting Started Explanation: Go to repl.it and create a new repl (project). Choose Python 2 as the language. 1: Output Explanation: Imagine that you are playing hangman, and need to pick a word. Output this word using print \"The correct word is ...\" . Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-01 2: Variables Explanation: Take your word from Step 1, and create a variable (perhaps call it word ?) to store it using name = value . Then, output its value using print \"The correct word is %s.\" % ( name ) . Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-02 3: Input Explanation: Create a new variable (perhaps call it guess ?) and use name = raw_input(\"Guess the word: \") to get input from the user. It's also a good idea to output the user's guess. Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-03 4: If/Else Statements Explanation: After getting input, check to see if the user's guess matches the correct word using if guess == word: . If it matches, output something nice! Otherwise, use else: to tell them that the guess is incorrect. Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-04 5: While Loops Explanation: Use a while loop to let the user keep guessing the word until they get it right (ie. keep guessing while guess != word ). You can even implement another variable to keep count of how many guesses it takes! Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-05 6: For Loops Explanation: Now, instead of asking the user to guess the entire word, ask them to guess just one letter instead. Every time they guess a letter, use a for loop to go through every letter of the correct word and compare it to the user's guess. If they match, output something (eg. print \"Found letter %s at index %d\" % (guess, i) ). Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-06 7: String Operations Explanation: Use string concatenation and string slicing like word[:i] + guess + word[i+1:] to keep track of which letters the user has correctly guess so far, and output them to the screen. Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-07 8: Lists Explanation: Create a pre-defined list of words (perhaps call it words ?) that you can choose from. Example: https://repl.it/@redapple410/hangman-08 9: Importing Modules Explanation: Import the random module using import random . Then, use word = random.choice(words) to randomly choose a word from the list you created in Step 8, and use it as the correct word for Hangman. (For those who are too lazy to consult the Library Reference, random.choice( list ) returns a random item from the given list.)
