# Hacking

!!! danger "Please learn to read carefully."
    Many people end up skimming over certain documents. You might be one of those people. You will **miss important information**. I can only do so much to **bold** and *highlight* key ideas, but if you skip on the details, be prepared to be very frustrated when wondering why nothing works.

**Looking for the cheat sheet? It's [here](cheat_sheet)!**

Welcome to our GitHub website. All resources located in our main branch can be found under Resources.

Here's a useful table of all our meetings:
