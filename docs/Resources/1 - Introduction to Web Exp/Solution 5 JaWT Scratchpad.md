## Problem Statement


### Lab 5: JaWT Scratchpad (400 pts, but imo should be 700)

**Problem:**

>Check the admin scratchpad! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12283/ or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12283

**Hints:**

1. What is that cookie?
2. Have you heard of JWT?

## Write-Up


Use the latest version of John-The-Ripper from GitHub to crack JWT signatures. You can also write a custom Python script to loop through the `rockyou` password list and perform a dictionary attack.
